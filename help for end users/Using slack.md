## Using Slack in Government

As a government user we expect a good degree of sophistication when working with data. We have a shared responsibility to keep the right things safe. This guidance will help you use Slack to communicate securely with colleagues.

### Securing your account
Secure your Slack account by using:

* a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
* [two-factor authentication](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication)
* a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or a [Slack client app](https://slack.com/downloads/)

Tell your Slack administrator if you :

* think someone may have accessed your account
* lose a device that can access your Slack account (you should also [sign yourself out of all channel sessions](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/how-to-sign-out-of-slack-on-all-devices-at-once/))

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using Slack, make sure you:

* don't use Slack to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed
* create and use [private channels or direct messages](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201925108-About-channels-and-direct-messages) when you need to control access
* restrict your Slack account to your organisation if appropriate

When using Slack, you should also be aware that content, including older messages you can no longer see, can be:

* disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
* [exported and viewed by administrators](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-data-exports) in paid Slack accounts, including direct messages and private channels
* exported and viewed by administrators in free Slack accounts, except for direct messages and private channels
* [subject to legal requests to shared data](https://slack.com/user-data-request-policy) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US

Slack have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://govuk.slack.com/privacy-shield-notice) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for personal data for their European customers. [You own the data](https://slack.com/privacy-policy) you put in Slack, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work. Make sure you don’t lose content by:

* creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
* using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from Slack by:

* copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
* taking a screenshot
* asking your administrator for an export

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government Slack accounts by:

* setting your username to first_last_organisation (for example alex_black_moj)
* use a recognisable profile photo
* add your role to the 'What I do' section

You don't have to share your phone number or Skype account if you don't want to.

You can alert others to content you have shared on Slack by typing @channel, @here, or @everyone. This can trigger notifications on their computer or phone. You can read the Slack guidance on ‘[Making an announcement](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement)’ to understand how these alerts working the meaning of these alerts.

You should avoid disruption to others when using these alerts by:

* only using the #announcement channel for things that are urgent, important and affect a lot of people
* avoiding use of @channel; @here and @everyone in #announcements
* using @here over @channel or @everyone unless you need to

###Getting help

For help using Slack, you can:

* access the [Slack help centre](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us) for guides and videos
* find your team owners or administrators (by looking in your account settings under Team Settings)

Slack also have a live [status page](https://status.slack.com/).

You may also access further support from:

* a service level agreement if you have a [paid Slack account](https://slack.com/pricing)
* your internal IT team (if you have agreed a support arrangement with them)
