## Using Slack

Guidance for people using Slack in government. As a government user we expect a good degree of sophistication when working with data. We have a shared responsibility to keep the right things safe.

### Security

Use a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0), and setup [two-factor authentication](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) for your account.

If you think someone may have accessed your account contact your administrator. If you lose a device that can access Slack contact your administrator and [sign yourself out of all sessions](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/how-to-sign-out-of-slack-on-all-devices-at-once/).

Use a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org) or a [Slack client app](https://slack.com/downloads/) to make sure you are using a secure (HTTPS) connection.

### Privacy

Don't use Slack to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data like commercial or financial information that could cause harm if lost or exposed.

Content could be disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/) as could any information held by government. All content in paid accounts can be retrieved by administrators. Content in free accounts can be retrieved by administrators except private messages that are no longer visible.

Slack [could be asked to share data](https://slack.com/user-data-request-policy) by the US government. 

Create public and private channels, and restrict your Slack account to your organisation if appropriate.

[Slack self-certify](https://govuk.slack.com/privacy-shield-notice) on the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) but don't offer [EU Model Clauses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/EU-Model-Clauses), although this is common for this type of application.  [You own the data](https://slack.com/privacy-policy) you put in Slack, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

Record or summarise important work information in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Use your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions, and name the data so it can be found later.

To export data from Slack copy and paste the text and note the date, or take a screenshot.  Alternatively ask your administrator for an export.

### Using Slack

Set your username to first_last, for example alex_black.  If the account is used by other organisations set your username to first_last_organisation, for example alex_black_moj.

Use a recognisable profile photo and put your role in 'What I do'.

Don't fill in your phone number or Skype account if you don't want to.

Use the [Slack help centre](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us) for guides and videos on using Slack.

Only use the #announcement channel things which are urgent, important and affect everyone. Avoid using @channel; @here and @everyone in #announcements.

Use @here over @channel or @everyone unless you need to.

Find out who your team owners or administrators are in your account settings under Team Settings.

### Support

Your internal IT team may not support Slack unless you have agreed that with them.  There is a [support site](https://get.slack.help) and a [status page](https://status.slack.com/), but no service level agreement unless you have a [paid account](https://slack.com/pricing).

### Administrator configuration

Administrators should connect to an existing identity and access management service (if you are using a paid account).  If this is not available regularly review and remove people who have left or no longer need access.

Require two-factor authentication on paid accounts, either [through Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212221668-Require-two-factor-authentication-for-your-team) or through your own identity and access management service.

Administrators should also manage roles and managed access appropriately, limiting the number of people with administrator access.  Separate administrator accounts from the general user accounts of administrators.

Slack uses [plugins](https://slack.com/apps) and an [API](https://api.slack.com/tokens) to share data with other services. [Disable user access to add plugins and connections](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/222386767-Managing-apps-for-your-team) and evaluate new app requests before approving.

If your account appears to have been breached [log all users out at once](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204510068-Reset-all-passwords-for-your-team).  They will need to reset their password to get back in.
