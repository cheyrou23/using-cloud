## Using Lucidchart and Lucidpress

Your technology enables you to use web applications you might not have previously been able to access.  As a government user we expect a good degree of sophistication when working with data.  We have a shared responsibility to keep the right things safe.

The technology team have evaluated Lucid against the [Cloud Security Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cloud-service-security-principles/cloud-service-security-principles) created by NCSC.

### About Lucidchart and Lucidpress

Lucidpress is a web-based drag and drop publishing and page layout application for creating content for print or digital.  Lucidchart is a web based diagramming tool similar to Microsoft Visio.

Only registered Team users are able to create and edit documents, but free accounts can create public documents and view documents people have shared with you.

###Security

Use a password made up of 3 random words, and ask your IT team to [setup single sign on](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300096-Lucidchart-and-SAML). Lucid do not yet support two factor authentication.

If you think someone may have accessed your account contact your administrator. If you lose a device that can access Lucid contact your administrator and [sign yourself out of all sessions](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/how-to-sign-out-of-slack-on-all-devices-at-once/).

Use a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org) or the [iOS app](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300176-iOS-10-Lucidchart-App-Quickview) to make sure you are using a secure (HTTPS) connection.

Lucidchart and Lucidpress are reasonably secure and appropriate for much of the information at OFFICIAL, but some information at is not appropriate.  Consider the type and sensitivity of the data you store with Lucid, and contact your IT security team for advice.

### Privacy

Don't use Lucid apps to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data like commercial or financial information that could cause harm if lost or exposed.

Content can be disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/). All content in paid accounts can be retrieved by administrators.

Lucid [may be asked to share data](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/privacy) by the US government. 

[Manage document permissions carefully](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300466-Share-Files-and-Folders) to ensure only those who need access can see them.

Lucid don't currently offer any data protection in line with European laws. [You own the data](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/privacy) you put in Lucid, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services, however they reserve the right to review documents to help resolve problems or to ensure compliance with their terms of service, so you should not consider documents private.

Data is hosted in the US by Amazon Web Services.

If you cancel your account you should delete your data first or [it may remain on Lucid servers](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tos).

### Information management guidance

* For information management purposes you should download copies of your completed documents in PDF, PNG, or VDX and store them in Google Drive.

* There is no content search on LucidChart Diagrams so title all diagrams in a clear and concise fashion in order to make them easy to find by others.

* Diagrams created in LucidChart are subject to FOI, DPA and EIR.  You should handle information in Lucid according to the information management guidelines for the UK government.

### Support

 * Like all cloud services the product could change over time.  New features are added or features may be withdrawn.  We have little control over this beyond the [feature request process](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/forums/21398513-Current-Feature-Requests). As a registered user you are able and encouraged to participate in this process to help guide the development of the product.

### Administrator configuration

Administrators should connect to an existing identity and access management service (if you are using a [paid account](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/enterprise)). If this is not available regularly review and remove people who have left or no longer need access. Alternatively if you use [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) you can require your users to authenticate via that.

Administrators should also manage roles and managed access appropriately, limiting the number of people with administrator access.  Separate administrator accounts from the general user accounts of administrators.

To keep live license numbers down you can periodically remove all user licenses. This reverts all accounts to the free tier without deleting data. When a user next logs in they can click to switch back to a paid account.

Allow users to [connect Lucidchart and Lucidpress to Google Drive](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300016-Lucidchart-in-Google-Drive) if it is used in your organisation, as it only requires permissions to files created in Lucid applications, not the entire Drive.
