## Using Lucidchart and Lucidpress

Guidance for people using Lucidchart and Lucidpress in government. As a government user we expect a good degree of sophistication when working with data. We have a shared responsibility to keep the right things safe.

### About Lucid apps

Lucidpress is a web-based drag and drop publishing and page layout application for creating print or digital content.

Lucidchart is a web-based diagramming tool similar to Microsoft Visio.

###Security

Use a password made up of 3 random words, and ask your IT team to [setup single sign on](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300096-Lucidchart-and-SAML). Lucid do not yet support two factor authentication.

If you think someone may have accessed your account contact your administrator.

Use a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org) or the [iOS app](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300176-iOS-10-Lucidchart-App-Quickview) to make sure you are using a secure (HTTPS) connection.

### Privacy

Don't use Lucid apps to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data like commercial or financial information that could cause harm if lost or exposed.

Content can be disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/). All content in paid accounts can be retrieved by administrators.

Data is hosted in the US by Amazon Web Services and Lucid [may be asked to share data](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/privacy) by the US government. 

[Manage document permissions carefully](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300466-Share-Files-and-Folders) to ensure only those who need access can see them.

Lucid don't currently offer data protection under European law such as the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome). [You own the data](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/privacy) you put in Lucid, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services, however they reserve the right to review documents to help resolve problems or to ensure compliance with their terms of service, so you should not consider documents private.

If you cancel your account you should delete your data first or [it may remain on Lucid servers](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tos).

### Information management

Record or summarise important work information in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Use your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions, and name the data so it can be found later as there is no content search within documents.

Download copies of your completed documents in PDF, PNG, or VDX.

### Using Lucid apps

Only registered Team users are able to create and edit documents, but free accounts can create public documents and view documents people have shared with you.

### Support

Your internal IT team may not support Lucid apps unless you have agreed that with them.  There is a [support site](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com) and [status updates on twitter](https://twitter.com/lucidchart), but no service level agreement unless you have a [paid account](https://www.lucidchart.com/users/registerLevel). 

Like all cloud services the product could change over time.  New features are added or may be withdrawn.  We have little control over this beyond the [feature request process](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/forums/21398513-Current-Feature-Requests). Registered users can participate in the process to help guide development.

### Administrator configuration

Administrators should connect to an existing identity and access management service (if you are using a [paid account](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/enterprise)). If this is not available regularly review and remove people who have left or no longer need access. Alternatively if you use [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) you can require your users to authenticate via that.

Administrators should also manage roles and managed access appropriately, limiting the number of people with administrator access.  Separate administrator accounts from the general user accounts of administrators.

To keep license numbers down you can periodically revoke all user licenses. This reverts accounts to the free tier without deleting data. When a user next logs in they can click to switch back to a paid account.

Allow users to [connect Lucidchart and Lucidpress to Google Drive](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207300016-Lucidchart-in-Google-Drive) if it is used in your organisation, as it only requires permissions to files created in Lucid applications, not the entire Drive.
