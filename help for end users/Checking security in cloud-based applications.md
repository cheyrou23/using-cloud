##Checking security in cloud-based applications

Check if a cloud-based application is safe to use.

If you aren't sure, or you are working with personal, or high value data, or large amounts of data, talk to your IT security team.

Before you start:

* know the type and volume of data you are working with
* give yourself time to investigate
* write down your findings so you have a record you can pass to your IT security team

### Say no sometimes

Most information classified as Official doesn't require more protection than many cloud-based applications offer, but there are times when the application doesn't provide enough protection for the data in use.

When you choose an application consider the consequences of your data being lost, stolen or seen by somebody that shouldn't have access to it.

If the data is meant to be public, it needs to be kept up-to-date.

>If the application will hold [personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or high value data, or large amounts of data, your IT security team should approve the application before use.

### Connect securely

Your connection to a web application must be secure and only use [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).  Look for the padlock symbol in the address bar or check the address begins with 'https://'. You can click the padlock for more detail.

>If your connection isn't secure you shouldn't use the application.

## Use a strong login

The application should let you use reasonably long and complex pass phrases. Pass phrases [made up of several words](https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/passwords) are ideal as they are [easy to remember and difficult to guess](http://xkcd.com/936/). You should also use a single sign on service or a sign on from a well protected service your organisation already uses.

Ideally you will be able to use [multi-factor authentication](http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now), where you need to approve or generate a code with another device, like your phone, when logging in from a new device.

Admin accounts that can control other users' access must be better protected and must use multi-factor authentication.

>If you can't use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for admins you shouldn't use the application.

>Ask your IT security team if a single sign on service is available. You must use one if your are storing personal or high value data, or if the application becomes important to running your organisation.

### Store data securely

Data must be well protected.  Encrypting data when not in use is strongly preferred and suggests good security practice but isn't always necessary.  Look for pages on security, privacy, terms of service, help, or legal, to see what protections exist.  Your IT security or legal team can help you understand these.

Data may be stored with a different organisation, and good protection is more important than location.  However, you should look for signs that the service is hosted in or supported from countries you wouldn't normally trust.

>Don't put data in applications that don't look like they protect your data or are run from unstable countries.

### Control access

You should be able to control who can access data, for example giving specific people access to a file or sharing a project plan with a specific team or organisation. Ideally there will be an administration function that lets you manage users and their access to data.

You should be able to block access to people when they leave the organisation, through technical means or an internal process.

You should be able to export your data in a standard format so you can move to another application, and properly manage the information.

If there will be a lot of people using the application you should be able to see who has logged in and what they have done, through a report, audit view, or log.

>If you can't know and control how data is being accessed you shouldn't use the application.

### Trust the organisation

Make sure the organisation that supplies the application is credible and reliable. Look for certifications like [ISO 27001](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm), [PCI standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security), and membership of frameworks like the [EU-US Privacy Shield](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/eu-us-privacy-shield/index_en.htm). These show a serious approach to security and a commitment to good data handling.

>If you see anything about the supplier that concerns you ask your IT security team for help.
