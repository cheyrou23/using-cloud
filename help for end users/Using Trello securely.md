## Using Trello

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use Trello to work securely with colleagues.

Trello is a cloud application for managing projects and sharing tasks.

### Secure your account

Secure your Trello account by using:

* a password made up of 3 random words
* [two-factor authentication](http://help.trello.com/article/993-enabling-two-factor-authentication-for-your-trello-account)
* a secure HTTPS connection (ensure this by using a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or a [Trello client app](https://trello.com/platforms)

Contact your Trello administrator if you:

* think someone may have accessed your account (you should also [change your password immediately](https://trello.com/forgot?user=)
* lose a device that can access Trello (you should also [sign yourself out of other sessions](http://help.trello.com/article/766-logging-out-of-trello)

### Protect your data

To protect your data when using Trello, make sure you:

* don't use Trello to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm if lost or exposed
* create [public and private boards](http://help.trello.com/article/789-changing-the-visibility-of-a-board-to-public-private-or-team) as appropriate
* donâ€™t connect Trello to [other services](https://trello.com/integrations)

When using Trello, you should also be aware that content can be:

* disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/), as could any information held by government
* retrieved by board owners or central administrators in paid Trello accounts
* seen by Trello staff (card titles show up in Trello system logs, so choose them carefully)

Trello [signed-up](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOWpAAO) to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for European customers. [You own the data](https://trello.com/privacy) you put in Trello, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Using trello

You can sign up for and use Trello for free or ask your IT team for a corporate account.

Set your username to first_last, for example alex_black.  If you are going to work on boards used by other organisations set your username to first_last_organisation, for example alex_black_moj.

Use a recognisable profile photo and put your role in 'What I do' so other people know who they are sharing information with.

Use the [tour](https://trello.com/tour), [getting started guide](https://trello.com/guide) and [help](http://help.trello.com/) for guidance on using Trello.

The Trello profile is public and that anyone with internet access can view it (e.g. [https://trello.com/nickwoodcraft](https://trello.com/nickwoodcraft)).  This does not expose activity, comments, cards, organisation, or other details and will not show up in web searches.

Sign up to Trello using your corporate email address to ensure separation between personal and work boards. [Delete your trello account](http://help.trello.com/article/749-deleting-your-trello-account) if you leave the organisation.

Talk to your IT or information security team before connecting Trello to another service.  For example you can connect trello to Google Drive, but this can give trello excessive access to Google Drive. If you have a paid account this option can be managed by your administrator.

### Managing information

Record or summarise important work information in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Data in Trello should be exported in csv format for keeping as a permanent record or for importing into spreadsheets or other database applications.  Name the data so it can be found later.

Users should include a link to the Trello board(s) of every project in anpther place, for example a document management system, to ensure the information stored there can be found in the future.  Boards that may be of historical interest should be shared directly with your knowledge management team.

Delete completed cards of no historical value to reduce the volume of data that needs to be managed.  To delete a card it should be [archived then deleted](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/935742-archiving-and-deleting-cards)

Close completed boards on the understanding that closed boards untouched for 12 months may be deleted to reduce the volume of data that needs to be managed.

### Support

Your internal IT team may not support Trello unless you have agreed that with them.  There is a [support site](http://help.trello.com/) and a [status page](http://www.trellostatus.com/), but no service level agreement unless you have a [paid account](https://trello.com/pricing).
