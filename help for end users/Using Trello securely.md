## Using Trello

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use Trello to work securely with colleagues.

Trello is a cloud application for managing projects and sharing tasks.

### Secure your account

Secure your Trello account by using:

* a password made up of 3 random words
* [two-factor authentication](http://help.trello.com/article/993-enabling-two-factor-authentication-for-your-trello-account)
* a secure HTTPS connection (ensure this by using a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or a [Trello client app](https://trello.com/platforms)

Contact your Trello administrator if you:

* think someone may have accessed your account (you should also [change your password immediately](https://trello.com/forgot?user=)
* lose a device that can access Trello (you should also [sign yourself out of other sessions](http://help.trello.com/article/766-logging-out-of-trello)

### Protect your data

To protect your data when using Trello, make sure you:

* don't use Trello to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm if lost or exposed
* create [public and private boards](http://help.trello.com/article/789-changing-the-visibility-of-a-board-to-public-private-or-team) as appropriate
* don’t connect Trello to [other services](https://trello.com/integrations)

When using Trello, you should also be aware that content can be:

* disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/), as could any information held by government
* retrieved by board owners or central administrators in paid Trello accounts
* seen by Trello staff (card titles show up in Trello system logs, so choose them carefully)

Trello [signed-up](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOWpAAO) to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for European customers. [You own the data](https://trello.com/privacy) you put in Trello, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Make sure you don’t lose content by:

* creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
* using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)
* including a link to the Trello board in related documents
* share boards that may be of historical interest with your information management team
* delete old cards of no historical value to reduce the volume of data that needs to be managed - [archived first then delete](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/935742-archiving-and-deleting-cards)
* [close boards](http://help.trello.com/article/801-deleting-a-board) when they are no longer needed

You can export data from Trello by:

* copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
* [print](http://help.trello.com/article/812-printing-in-trello) to a PDF
* [export to CSV](http://help.trello.com/article/747-exporting-data-from-trello-1) if you have a Business Class (paid for) account
* taking a screenshot
* asking your administrator for [an export](http://help.trello.com/article/747-exporting-data-from-trello-1)

### Using trello

You can sign up for and use Trello for free or ask your IT team for a corporate account.

Set your username to first_last, for example alex_black.  If you are going to work on boards used by other organisations set your username to first_last_organisation, for example alex_black_moj.

Use a recognisable profile photo and put your role in 'What I do' so other people know who they are sharing information with.

Use the [tour](https://trello.com/tour), [getting started guide](https://trello.com/guide) and [help](http://help.trello.com/) for guidance on using Trello.

The Trello profile is public and that anyone with internet access can view it (e.g. [https://trello.com/nickwoodcraft](https://trello.com/nickwoodcraft)).  This does not expose activity, comments, cards, organisation, or other details and will not show up in web searches.

Sign up to Trello using your corporate email address to ensure separation between personal and work boards. [Delete your trello account](http://help.trello.com/article/749-deleting-your-trello-account) if you leave the organisation.

Talk to your IT or information security team before connecting Trello to another service.  For example you can connect trello to Google Drive, but this can give trello excessive access to Google Drive. If you have a paid account this option can be managed by your administrator.

### Support

Your internal IT team may not support Trello unless you have agreed that with them.  There is a [support site](http://help.trello.com/) and a [status page](http://www.trellostatus.com/), but no service level agreement unless you have a [paid account](https://trello.com/pricing).
