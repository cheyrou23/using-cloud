## Using WhatsApp in Government

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use WhatsApp to communicate securely with colleagues.

[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) is a mobile messaging app on Android, iOS, [web](https://web.whatsapp.com/), or desktop. Your organisation may not provide WhatsApp but you should follow this guidance if you find yourself using it for work.

### Securing your account
Secure your WhatsApp account by using:

* a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
* [two-factor authentication](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/26000021/?category=5245245)
* a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or a [WhatsApp client app](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/)

Messages, calls, and location information is encrypted on your device and in transit. 'About' information, profile photos, group information, and address books are visible to WhatsApp.

If you think someone may have accessed your account via the web or desktop use the mobile app to [log out other sessions](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/web/26000018/?category=5245246)

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using WhatsApp, make sure you:

* don't use WhatsApp to share [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed
* [verify security codes](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/28030015/?category=5245250) when you need to be sure your conversation is protected
* [enable security notifications](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/28030014/?category=5245250) so you know when a contact is using a different device
* [limit your privacy settings](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/21197244/?category=5245250) so only contacts can see your profile and status

When using WhatsApp, you should also be aware that content can be:

* disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
* [subject to legal requests to shared data](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/26000050/?category=5245250) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US
* copied out by recipients, even if your later delete the chat

As any WhatsApp content can be subject to the Freedom of Information Act you should:

* communicate as you would in internal email
* choose good group names

Using WhatsApp for social or personal use must:

* not create exposure to legal liability or embarrassment
* not affect your performance or disrupt others
* follow the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code)

[WhatsApp collect, store, and share information about you](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy-information-we-collect).  This includes profile name, profile picture, and status messages, group information, and address books. Their technical security is better than other popular message services and comparable to Signal or Wickr.

### Managing information

Sometimes you may need to refer back to information shared in WhatsApp groups. As a civil servant you must [keep accurate records](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) of work. Make sure you donâ€™t lose content by:

* creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
* using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from WhatsApp by:

* [emailing the chat text](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/) from your phone 
* copying and pasting the text from the web or desktop app (while noting the date)
* taking a screenshot on your phone

Limit channels to:

* work and discussion  
* networks and clubs
* noticeboards

Name channels clearly with the team, community, product, network, club, or group so it is obvious what is being discussed. Avoid creating channels without an obvious work or community purpose.

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government WhatsApp users by:

* setting your visible name to First Last (Organisation) - for example Alex Black (MOJ)
* use a recognisable profile photo

Use @name to alert someone in a group. This can trigger notifications on their computer or phone, even if they have muted the group. [Read the FAQ](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/).
